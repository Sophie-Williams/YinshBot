## Algorithms
+ Used miminax with alpha-beta pruning and sorting based on a action evaluation function to search ahead 3-6 moves depending on the branching factor
+ Used a hand designed weighted set of features to evaluate moves 

## Schematics
+ main.cpp - Game engine encapsulating the entire bot
+ compile.sh - Compile scripts
+ run.sh - Execution scripts
